# Automated Rain Fall Simulator Test Bench </br>
<b>Automated rainfall-simulator microcontroller based system for characterizing permeability of technical-textiles</b> </br>

The agriculture nets permeability test bench is a system to run permeability test on wide variety of materials quickly and accurately. By adjusting the gradient or the flow rate across the sample, the system can measure permeability of agriculture nets while simulating the rain-falls of varying intensities. The test bench includes a linear actuator, centrifugal pump, flow sensors, flow regulators, HMI display and electronic controls. Flow rates can be set to any value between 0.6 l/min to 15 l/min. Once the system is setup the test can be run unattended in a fully automated mode. </br>
